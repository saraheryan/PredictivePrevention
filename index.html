     <p> Can combining person-generated data with existing health data help us predict poor health in the future and
     create an opportunity to prevent it with more personalised advice and services? </p>
          
     <p> Our ambition: 

- Enable personalised public health interventions to be provided much earlier
- Empowering people to take greater control of their health - particularly the most vulnerable and disadvantaged parts of society
- Prevent avoidable illness.
- More accurately predict and mitigate risks to the publicâ€™s health. 
- Contribute to the Secretary of State's vision to achieve an extra 5 years of Disability Free Life Expectancy </p>
